See mdep/nt and mdep/x for examples of two working ports of KeyKit.

This is a list of the files and functions expected in
the machine-dependent layer of KeyKit.

==========================================================================

IN FILE: mdep1.c
----------------
void mdep_hello(int argc,char **argv);

	First function called - starts things up (but doesn't start graphics).

void mdep_bye(void);

	Cleans up before exit.

int mdep_changedir(char *d);

	Changes to the specified directory (e.g. like "cd" in a shell).

char * mdep_currentdir(char *buff,int leng);

	Returns the full path of the current directory in buff, whose
	length is leng.

int mdep_lsdir(char *dir, char *exp, void (*callback)(char *,int));

	Scans the files of the named dir, using exp as a regular expression
	to filter what things are of interest (e.g. *.k).  For each file
	or directory, the callback function is invoked, passing it the
	name of the file or directory, and an integer which is 0 if it's
	a file, 1 if it's a directory. 

long mdep_filetime(char *fn);

	Returns the modification time of the named file.

int mdep_fisatty(FILE *f);

	Returns non-zero if the given FILE stream is a tty-like device
	(like a console).  I don't know how important this one is anymore,
	it may be obsolete at this point.

long mdep_currtime(void);

	Returns the current time (in UNIX-style seconds).

long mdep_coreleft(void);

	Returns the number of bytes of memor available for dynamic allocation.

int mdep_full_or_relative_path(char *path);

	Returns non-zero if the named path is a full path (e.g. /x/y
	on UNIX or c:\x\y on DOS) or relative path (e.g. ../x/y on UNIX).

int mdep_makepath(char *dirname, char *filename, char *result, int resultsize);

	Concatenates a directory and filename to make a full pathname,
	putting the result into result, whose size is resultsize.

==========================================================================

IN FILE: mdep2.c
----------------

void mdep_popup(char *s);

	Brings up a pop-up window, displaying the string s.  Should include
	buttons that let the user dismiss the pop-up, i.e. it should be a
	modal box.

int mdep_statconsole(void);

	Return non-zero if the console has pending characters.  This one
	may be obsolete.

int mdep_getconsole(void);

	Return the next character from the console.  This one may be obsolete.

void mdep_prerc(void);

	Called after mdep_hello(), and after KeyKit symbols are
	set up, but before mdep_startgraphics().

void mdep_initcolors(void);

	Called right after mdep_startgraphics, and is expected to
	set the first 5 colors (0,1,2,3,4) that are used for
	background, foreground, pick-highlighting, and the 2 shades
	of grey for 3-d buttons.  One example of a consistent
	set would be white,black,red,light-grey,dark-grey.
	Note that these colors can be changed, later on, by the
	user (with colormix()).

char * mdep_keypath(void);

	Returns the KEYPATH value (list of lib directories).

char * mdep_musicpath(void);

	Returns the MUSICPATH value (list of music directories).

void mdep_postrc(void);

	Called after the initial KeyKit prerc() and postrc() functions
	are executed.

void mdep_abortexit(char *s);

	Quit with the given message.

int mdep_shellexec(char *s);

	Execute the command via a shell.

void mdep_setinterrupt(SIGFUNCTYPE i);

	Arrange things so that the specified function is called when
	an interrupt (from the console, e.g. hitting break) is seen.

void mdep_ignoreinterrupt(void);

	Arrange for interrupts to be ignored.

int mdep_waitfor(int tmout);

	Wait for an event, with a timeout in milliseconds.  
	mdep_waitfor(tm) should block until something happens,
	or until 'tmout' milliseconds have elapsed.
	If something happens, mdep_waitfor() should return one
	and only one of these values:
	
	    K_CONSOLE - console input is available
	    K_MOUSE - mouse state has changed
	    K_WINDEXPOSE - window has been exposed and/or needs redrawing
	    K_WINDRESIZE - window has changed size
	    K_MIDI - MIDI input is available
	    K_PORT - input on a port (see mdep_openport below) is available
	    K_TIMEOUT - the timeout has elapsed
	    K_QUIT - the parent OS has requested that the application shut down
	
	No input should be discarded when calling mdep_waitfor().
	Other routines (e.g. getconsole, getnmidi) will be called to
	retrieve the data, however there is no guarantee that they
	will be called before the next call to mdep_waitfor(),
	so mdep_waitfor() should continue to return non-zero values
	(indicating what input is still available) until the input data has
	actually been retrieved.
	
	If no data is available, and the specified timeout occurs, then
	mdep_waitfor() returns with a value of K_TIMEOUT.  The timeout
	may be 0 - in this case, input should still be checked, and only
	if there is no input pending should a value of K_TIMEOUT be returned.

int mdep_startgraphics(int argc,char **argv);

	Initialize graphics - bring up the window.

char * mdep_browse(char *desc, char *types, int mustexist);

	Pop up a file-selection browser.  Desc is a description of the
	type of file desired, types is a regular expression list,
	and if mustexist is non-zero, then only existing files can
	be selected.  The return value is the full path name of
	the file selected, or NULL if no file was selected.

int mdep_screenresize(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1);

	Resizes the graphics window on the display.

int mdep_screensize(int *x0, int *y0, int *x1, int *y1);

	Returns the current coordinates of the graphics window on
	the display.  This is NOT the same as mdep_maxx/maxy - partly
	because in mdep_screensize() the origin is not usually 0,0,
	because it also takes into account any border on the window.
	The only (current) use of these values is to give them back to
	mdep_screenresize() to restore a given size/location of
	the display.

int mdep_maxx(void);

	Returns the maximum displayable X coordinate in the graphics display.
	The minimum displayable X coordinate is always 0.

int mdep_maxy(void);

	Returns the maximum displayable Y coordinate in the graphics display.
	The minimum displayable Y coordinate is always 0.

void mdep_plotmode(int mode);

	Set the plotting mode for future drawing requests.  mode can
	be one of P_STORE, P_CLEAR, or P_XOR.

void mdep_endgraphics(void);

	Terminate graphics mode (prior to final exiting).

void mdep_line(int x0,int y0,int x1,int y1);

	Draw a line, using current drawing mode.  The line should include
	the final endpoint (x1,y1).

void mdep_box(int x0,int y0,int x1,int y1);

	Draw a rectangle, using current drawing mode.  The sides and corner
	should include the x1,y1 point.

void mdep_boxfill(int x0,int y0,int x1,int y1);

	Draw a filled rectangle, using current drawing mode.  The sides
	and corner should include the x1,y1 point.

void mdep_ellipse(int x0,int y0,int x1,int y1);

	Draw the outline of an ellipse in the specified area,
	using current drawing mode.  Only STORE and CLEAR modes need
	to be supported.

void mdep_fillellipse(int x0,int y0,int x1,int y1);

	Draw a filled ellipse in the specified area,
	using current drawing mode.  Only STORE and CLEAR modes need
	to be supported.

Pbitmap mdep_allocbitmap(int xsize,int ysize);

	Allocate a bitmap of the given size.

Pbitmap mdep_reallocbitmap(int xsize,int ysize,Pbitmap pb);

	Re-allocate a bitmap of the given size.

void mdep_freebitmap(Pbitmap pb);

	Free the memory of the specified bitmap.

void mdep_movebitmap(int fromx0,int fromy0,int width,int height,int tox0,int toy0);

	Move a rectangular region on the screen.  (Not required - it
	can use pull/putbitmap functions instead, this function is
	only provided as an optimization so text scrolling can be
	improved if necessary.)
	
void mdep_pullbitmap(int x0,int y0,Pbitmap pb);
	
	Grab a bitmap off of the screen (upper-left corner at x0,y0),
	putting it into Pbitmap pb.

void mdep_putbitmap(int x0,int y0,Pbitmap pb);

	Put the bitmap in bp back onto the screen at x0,y0.

int mdep_mouse(int *ax,int *ay, int *am);

	Get the current status of the mouse, putting the position into
	*ax,*ay, and putting the current status of modifiers into *am.
	Modifier values are: 1 for the control key, 2 for the shift key.

int mdep_mousewarp(int x, int y);

	Move the mouse cursor to the given point.

void mdep_color(int n);

	Set the current foreground color to color index n.  In other words,
	the foreground drawing color for all future drawing operations
	will be be color index n.

void mdep_colormix(int n,int r,int g,int b);

	Specifies the rgb values for a given color index.

void mdep_sync(void);

	Make sure all graphics output is flushed.

char * mdep_fontinit(char *fnt);

	Set up the named font.

int mdep_fontheight(void);

	Returns the height (in pixels) of the current font.

int mdep_fontwidth(void);

	Returns the width (in pixels) of the current font.

void mdep_string(int x, int y, char *s);

	Draws a text string at location x,y (in pixels).  Should
	be done in the current plotting mode.  It's very important
	that the background of the character cell be transparent,
	i.e. only the actual character is drawn, so the existing
	background on the screen is not disturbed.

void mdep_setcursor(int type);

	Sets the mouse cursor icon - types are: M_ARROW (normal pointer),
	M_CROSS (a plus), M_SWEEP (for sweeping a rectangular area),
	M_LEFTRIGHT (for sweeping left/right), M_UPDOWN (for sweeping 
	up/down), M_ANYWHERE (for moving something anywhere), M_BUSY (an
	hourglass), and M_NOTHING (invisible).

PORTHANDLE * mdep_openport(char *name, char *mode, char *type)

	This function allows access to machine-dependent ports, such
	as TCP/IP sockets, or AREXX connections, or whatever.  The name,
	mode, and type are passed unmodified from the parameters of
	the KeyKit language's built-in open() function.  The mode value
	will typically be "rw" or something like that, but the name
	and type are unrestricted.  The return value of this function
	is a pointer to an array of PORTHANDLE's, representing the two
	ports that were created (in the case when mode=="rw").
	PORTHANDLE is a machine-dependent type that should be defined
	in mdep.h

	When input data is available on one or more of these ports,
	the mdep_waitfor() function should return a value of K_PORT.

int mdep_putportdata(PORTHANDLE h, char *buff, int size)

	Output the specified buffer of data (size bytes, pointed to by buff)
	to port h.  Returns the number of bytes transmitted.

int mdep_getportdata(PORTHANDLE *hp, char *buff, int buffsize)

	This function will return data from one of the ports that has input.
	If no ports currently have pending input, the return
	value is -1.  Otherwise, the return value is the number of
	bytes that were read, the hp pointer is used to return the
	value of the PORTHANDLE for the port, and the data is placed
	into the memory pointed to by buff (whose size, not to be
	exceeded, is buffsize).  If the return value is 0, then the
	port has been closed (not by use, presumably by the other end).
	This function is normally called repeatedly (emptying all
	available input) until it returns -1.


int mdep_closeport(PORTHANDLE h)

	Closes the indicated port.

Datum mdep_mdep(int argc)

	This function may be in midi.c rather than mdep2.c.
	This function provides a hook for machine-dependent operations
	that are made available via KeyKit's built-in "mdep()" function.
	The style of mdep_mdep() is much like the bi_* functions in bltin.c,
	for example the arguments that are passed (at the KeyKit level)
	are accessible within mdep_mdep() by using the ARG() macro.
	The return value of mdep_mdep() is a Datum that
	will be the return value of the KeyKit "mdep()" function.
	For Windows, the implementation of mdep_mdep() allows
	you to use the following statements within KeyKit code:

	mdep("midi","output","list")	# returns a list of the
					# value MIDI output devices
	mdep("midi","output","close")	# closes the current MIDI output device
	mdep("midi","output","open",N)	# opens MIDI output device #N

	If you don't want any machine-dependent capabilies, just
	have mdep_mdep() return the value Noval.

int mdep_help(char *fname, char *keyword)

	This provides access to an on-line help machanism.
	The fname argument is the filename (with no suffix (like .hlp))
	of one of the documentation files (e.g. "tools") and the keyword
	argument is the name of a keyword (e.g. "kboom") that controls
	what page of the document will be displayed.  If successful, this
	function returns 0.  If you don't want to provide on-line help,
	or there is an error, return 1.

==========================================================================

IN FILE: midi.c
----------------

int mdep_getnmidi(char *buff,int buffsize);

	Get as many MIDI input bytes as you can (though not exceeding
	buffsize in number), and put them in buff.  Returns the 
	number of bytes retrieved.  Active sensing bytes should be removed
	from the MIDI input stream, if they aren't already by the operating
	system.  Running status is okay, and complete MIDI messages do not
	have to be received in a single chunk.

void mdep_putnmidi(int n,char *cp);

	Send n MIDI bytes (from cp) to MIDI output.  All MIDI messages
	are guaranteed to be sent with a single call to putnmidi.

void mdep_endmidi(void);

	Shut down MIDI devices.

int mdep_initmidi(void);

	Initialize MIDI devices.

==========================================================================

IN FILE: clock.c
----------------

long mdep_milliclock(void);

	Return the current time in milliseconds.

void mdep_resetclock(void);

	Reset the offset of the values returned by mdep_milliclock().
	I.e. the current time is henceforth considered time=0.
