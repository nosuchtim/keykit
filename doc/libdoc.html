<dl>

<p>
<dt><b>addbootfunc(func)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Adds a function to the list of functions that will be
automatically invoked when KeyKit is rebooted.
<p>
<dt><b>allsusoff()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a phrase containing a "sustain off" on all channels.
  Useful for resetting things if you have a hanging note.
<p>
<dt><b>ano()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a phrase containing all-notes-off messages on each channel.
This does not include note-offs for each individual note, however.
<p>
<dt><b>apply(target,source,apptype,startquant)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Apply stuff (pitch, volume, timing, etc.) from the source phrase
to the target phrase.  The apptype is the bitwise-or of PITCH,
VOLUME, DURATION, TIME, EXACTTIME, CHANNEL.
Default apptype is TIME|DURATION
<p>
<dt><b>applyfunc(p,func,chunksize)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function splits a phrase into chunksize-sized chunks,
applies the function func to some of them (every other one,
by default), and returns the result, pasted back together.
<p>
<dt><b>arpeggio(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns an arpeggiated version of the phrase.  One way of describing
it is that all the notes have been separated and then put back
together, back-to-back.
<p>
<dt><b>arrayprint(array)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Prints all the elements in the given array.
Works for arrays of any dimension.
<p>
<dt><b>arraysort  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Sorts the elements in the given array,
and returns the sorted array.
<p>
<dt><b>attime(phrase,time)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns those notes in the specified phrase that are
sounding at the specified time.  If a note ends exactly
at the specified time, it is not included.
<p>
<dt><b>bpm(beatsperminute)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Changes the tempo based on beats per minute,
rather than microseconds per beat
<p>
<dt><b>bsdemo()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is an example of using the bsguide() function.
<p>
<dt><b>bsguide(arr,arrkey,keyguide,noteguide,stepsize,lng)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Synthesize a monophonic phrase based on these arguments:

arr
.br
An array whose elements are phrases, each one specifying
the allowable notes that can be used on a given step.
For example, if bsarr contained these elements:
arr[1]='c' ; arr[2]='c,e,g' ; arr[3]='c,g' ; arr[4]='g'
then only a 'c' would be allowed in the first step, and
the second step would allow a 'c', 'e', or 'g'.
The arr array can be of any size; when it runs out,
it is reused from the beginning.  For example, in the
example above, the fifth step would allow only a 'c'.

arrkey
.br
The key that the phrases in the arr array are meant
to be in.  E.g. in the example above, the value of arrkey
would most likely be 'c'.  This is needed so that
the arr array can be transposed to other keys.

keyguide
.br
A phrase that will determine the key (or really, chords)
in the final result.  For example, if the value of
keyguide was 'c,c,c,f', the notes picked during the first
three beats would be based in C, and the final beat would
be based in F.  Essentially the phrases in the arr array
are transposed based on these notes.

noteguide
.br
A phrase whose notes will be used as "guide" points in
picking the pitches in the final result.  For example,
if the guide phrase was 'co5,co4,co3', then the first note
in the final result would be as close as possible to 'co5',
and the note picked on the second beat would be as close as
possible to 'co4'.  If the notes of guide are very close
together, then they will strongly influence the general shape
of the final result.  If instead the notes of guide are
farther apart, then the final result will be allowed to meander
more freely between the guide notes (but still subject to the
contraints of the arr array described above).  E.g. a guide
phrase of 'co5d384,co4' would allow 4 beats of meandering
before being pushed back toward 'co4'.

stepsize
.br
This is the step size of the final result.  E.g. a value
of 1b/4 means the result would consist of sixteenth notes.

lng
.br
The desired length of the final result.

<p>
<dt><b>canonic(note)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the canonical pitch of a note,
ie. a number between 0 and 11.
<p>
<dt><b>chadjust(melody,chords)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Adjusts the notes of the melody phrase so that they fall on the notes
of the chords that are playing (at the same time) in the chords phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>changeprogchange(p,frompatchnum,topatchnum)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return p, where every program change message matching
the frompatchnum is changed to topatchnum.
The program change numbers are 1-based.
<p>
<dt><b>chaninfo(p)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a string giving channel information about phrase p.
<p>
<dt><b>chfilter(melody,chord)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a copy of the melody phrase, leaving only those notes that
match the chords that occur in the chord phrase at the same time.
<p>
<dt><b>chord(root,type,oct)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a chord, where root is the root note, oct is the
octave number, and type is a string that identifies the
type of chord - possible values are:
"major", "minor", "maj7", "min7", "maj9", "min9", "sus", "dim", "aug", 
"Maj69", "MajB769", "HalfDim", "Dim9", 
"NModMaj1", "NModMaj2", "NModMaj3",

"Vitr1", "Vitr2", "Fourths", "Pr1", "Pr2", "Pr3", "Pr4"
<p>
<dt><b>closest(note,scale [,direction] )  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns a note from the specified scale that is closest in pitch
to the specified note.  If the optional direction argument is given,
it specifies the direction (1==up, -1==down) that we want the
chosen note to be in (relative to the original note).  Specifying
the direction also guarantees that a note different from the
original is chosen (if possible).
<p>
<dt><b>closestmap(nt,map)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
The map argument is a set of notes.  This function takes the
single note nt and changes its pitch to the closest note in the map set.
<p>
<dt><b>closestt(phrase,time,limit)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return the single note in the specified phrase that is closest
in time to the specified time.  If the limit argument is given,
the search is limited to notes within that amount of time
(i.e. to notes between (time-limit) and (time+limit)).
<p>
<dt><b>completescale(key,scalename)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a phrase which is in the given key and scale, and extends
from the lowest note (in the key/scale) to the highest note.
<p>
<dt><b>completescalephrase(p)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a phrase which has the notes in p duplicated across all octaves.
<p>
<dt><b>consloop()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is intended to be the one-and-only task that reads from
the Consinfifo, a special fifo that is automatically opened
whenever KeyKit is booted, and to which KeyKit sends any characters
typed on the console.  consloop() forwards the characters to whatever
task is supposed to be reading the console.  If Consgrabfifo is
set, it will send them there, otherwise it sends them to the
main command interpreter, which is reading from interpfifo.
<p>
<dt><b>constant()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function initializes various constants that
are needed by other funcitons.
<p>
<dt><b>controller(ch,cn,val)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a controller message, where ch is the channel (1-based),
cn is the controller number, and val is the value.
Removes all bank-select controller messages (controller 0
followed by controller 32) from a phrase.
Note that it leaves the program change message
which usually follows.
<p>
<dt><b>dedup(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Remove any duplicate notes (in time and pitch) from a phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>dedupdur(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Remove any duplicate notes (including comparison of duration)
from a phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>delay(ph,tm)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return phrase ph, delayed by time tm.
Removes all rests (sections where nothing is playing)
from a phrase.
Set up input/output ports.  Look for a file keylocal.k first,
and if that doesn't exist, use some defaults
<p>
<dt><b>dupsof(p)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return a phrase containing one copy of any notes that
are duplicated in phrase p
<p>
<dt><b>echo(ph,num,rtime,rfactor)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return phrase ph echoed num times, with rtime delay between
each echo, and with the volume of each echo decreased by rfactor.
NEW BEHAVIOUR - 8/9/99 - the length of the result is
now explicitly set.  This is more "right", but some algorithms
may have been depending (unknowingly) on the old semantic.
<p>
<dt><b>echomaster(ph,fnum,ftime,ffactor,bnum,btime,bfactor)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return phrase ph with echoes, forward and back.
fnum is the number of forward echos, ftime is the echo time, ffactor
is the volume reduction factor.  bnum/btime/bfactor is for the
backward echos.
<p>
<dt><b>evalstring(s)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Takes a string and evals it.  Useful when you want to
put something in the background - you just "task evalstring(...)"
<p>
<dt><b>eventime(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return phrase ph with all of its notes evenly spaced in time.
<p>
<dt><b>filetopitches(filename)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
<p>
<dt><b>findroot(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Given a phrase, try to guess the root of what's being played.
The algorithm was given to me by Christopher John Rolfe (rolfe@sfu.ca),
who says it was culled from W.Russo, Jazz Composition and Orchestration,
p.25, ex.7.
<p>
<dt><b>findtask(function_name)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function looks for a running task that is executing
the named function (which is specified as a string, not as
a function value).  If found, the task id is returned.
If not found, the return value is -1.
<p>
<dt><b>flip(phrase [,about])  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Flip the pitches of the specified phrase about some intermediate
pitch (i.e. high notes become lower, and low notes become higher).
Given a single argument, the flip is done about the average pitch
of the original phrase.  A second argument can specify a particular
pitch about which to flip.
<p>
<dt><b>floor(f)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the floor (maximum integer that is less than f).
<p>
<dt><b>fractal(ph,depth)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns phrase ph fractalized - each note becomes a miniature
version of the entire phrase, transposed by the note's pitch.
The depth determines how many times this process is repeated.
Watch out, this will produce huge phrases.
<p>
<dt><b>gcd(n1,...)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the greatest common divisor of all of its arguments
<p>
<dt><b>gcd2(n1,n2)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers
<p>
<dt><b>getsysexdump(sendmessage,tmout)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function retrieves a sysex dump from an attached MIDI device.
The 'sendmessage' argument is expected to be a sysex message that,
when sent to the device, will cause it to send back a sysex dump
(or any sysex message, really).  For example, for a TX81Z, the
value of 'xf0432004f7' will cause it to send back a sysex dump
containing all patches.  The 'tmout' parameter is a timeout value
in milliseconds - if this time elapses without receiving any output
from MIDI input, the function will abort and return an empty phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>gmresetall()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns a phrase containing controller messages that reset
everything appropriately for the beginning of
a General MIDI piece.
<p>
<dt><b>grabmouse()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function arranges for all mouse messages to be intercepted and
sent to a particular window, rather than being routed to the windows
underneath the mouse.  When you want to restore things to normal,
call ungrabmouse().
<p>
<dt><b>grabmousefifo()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function arranges for all mouse messages to be intercepted and
sent to a new fifo, rather than being routed to the windows underneath
the mouse.  The fifo id of this new fifo is returned as the value
of grabmousefifo().  When you want to restore things to normal,
call ungrabmousefifo().
<p>
<dt><b>gridinit()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is the code that initializes the graphics mode of KeyKit.
It starts up things like the mouseloop() task, which handles
mouse input, and sets up the screen with the initial tool set
by calling toolrc().
<p>
<dt><b>highest(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the highest-pitched note in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>highestnt(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the highest-pitched note in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>inport(port)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Open a MIDI input port
<p>
<dt><b>interploop()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is the main command interpreter that executes the statements
that a user types interactively on the console.  It reads from
the interpfifo fifo, and characters are normally put on this fifo
by consloop().
<p>
<dt><b>isinscale(note,scale)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return true (non-zero) if the specified note exists in the
specified scale.  The scale phrase need only specify a give pitch
once - it is assumed to be duplicated over all octaves.
<p>
<dt><b>isnearbeat(note ,beat_interval, tolerance )  </b><dd>
</listitem>
<p>
<dt><b>isonbeat(note [,beat_interval] )  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns true (non-zero) if the given note lands on the beat.
The default beat interval is 1b; a second argument can specify an
different interval (e.g. isonbeat(note,4b) would return
true if the note fell on any 4-beat mark).
<p>
<dt><b>keyrc()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is the very first function called by KeyKit,
unless the -r option is specified when KeyKit is invoked.
This function must initialize everything necessary
for the proper running of KeyKit.  This is normally done
by calling normboot() to set up the command interpreter and
start other primary tasks.
<p>
<dt><b>khslider(vmin,vmax,vinit,invokefunc,args)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Create a horizontal slider object and return its id.  When slider is
moved, the invokefunc will be called with 2 arguments - the first
will be the current value of the slider, and the second will be the
args value.  The vmin, vmax, and vinit values are the minimum,
maximum, and initial values for the slider.
<p>
<dt><b>kslider(vmin,vmax,vinit,invokefunc,args)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Create a slider object and return its id.  When the slider is
moved, the invokefunc will be called with 2 arguments - the first
will be the current value of the slider, and the second will be the
args value.  The vmin, vmax, and vinit values are the minimum,
maximum, and initial values for the slider.
<p>
<dt><b>kvalbutton(vals)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
<p>
<dt><b>lastbunch(ph,spc,types)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return the last "bunch" of notes in ph.  The value of spc is the time
that determines where the bunch ends - as soon as a blank space of
that size is detected, the bunch has ended.  This is useful for
grabbing the last little bit of the Recorded phrase.
If a third argument is given, it is a bitmask of note types
to look for - all other types are ignored.
<p>
<dt><b>latest(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return the ending time of the latest note in the given phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>legato(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Extends the duration of each note to abutt the start of the next note.
Doesn't modify the duration of the last note.
<p>
<dt><b>limitval(v,minv,maxv)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Takes a number and limits it to the specified range.
<p>
<dt><b>listports()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
A simple utility that lists the available MIDI ports to the console.
<p>
<dt><b>lowest(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the lowest pitch in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>lowestnt(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the lowest-pitched note in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>makenote(pitch [,duration [,volume [,chan]]] )  </b><dd>
</listitem>
A simple utility for generating a single-note phrase.
The pitch is the only required argument; additional
arguments specify the duration, velocity, and channel.
<p>
<dt><b>makerootevery(melody,intrvl)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Figure out a root note (using findroot()) every intrvl beats,
and return it.
<p>
<dt><b>maxvolume(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the largest volume in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>midiloop()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is intended to be the one-and-only task which reads messages
from the Midiinfifo, a special fifo that is opened whenever KeyKit
is rebooted, and to which KeyKit sends messages containing
all MIDI input.  Any task wanting to read MIDI input should add
an entry to the Midiin array.  The index of the Midiin array
is normally the task id, and the value of the array element
is the fifo id.
<p>
<dt><b>milliclicks(milli)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the number of clicks equivalent to the specified
number of milliseconds.  Note that this is dependent upon
the current tempo().
<p>
<dt><b>millisince(tm)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the number of milliseconds since a given time
<p>
<dt><b>millisleep(milli)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Sleep (i.e. pause the task which calls this function)
for the specified number of milliseconds.
<p>
<dt><b>minduration(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the smallest duration in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>minvolume(phrase)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns the lowest volume in the specified phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>mono(phrase,type)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns a monophonic version of the specified phrase.
If type==0, high notes are given priority (e.g. if two notes are
playing simultaneously, the higher note will be chosen).
If type==1, low notes are given priority.  If type==2,
the priority is randomized.
<p>
<dt><b>mouseloop()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This task is intended to be the one-and-only task that reads
directly from the Mousefifo, a special fifo that is opened
whenever KeyKit is rebooted, and to which KeyKit sends messages
about changes in the mouse state.  mouseloop() normally figures
out which window is underneath the mouse, and sends the message
to the Mousein fifo for that window.  If someone wants to grab the
mouse, they should set Mousegrabwind, and mouseloop() will instead
send the mouse messages to that window.  This procedure should be done
with the grabmouse() and ungrabmouse() functions.
<p>
<dt><b>nanopatch(ch,bank,prog)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return sysex that changes a parts bank/program.
Assumes that the 16 parts are assigned to channels 1-16.
ch is 1-based
bank is 0-based
prog is 0-based
<p>
<dt><b>nextquant(number,quantize)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function quantizes the specified number using the specified
quantize value, and returns the result.  The result is guaranteed to
be greater than the original number; if quantization would produce
a smaller number, it is increased by the quantize value.  This is
typically used when you want to quantize a time value, and want to
guarantee that the result will refer to some time in the future,
not in the past.
<p>
<dt><b>nexttime(ph,st)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return the time of the next note AFTER time 'st', in phrase 'ph'
If there are no notes after it, returns -1;
<p>
<dt><b>nonnotes(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return all non-notes (i.e. controller, sysex, etc) of ph.
<p>
<dt><b>normboot()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This is intended to be the default function that gets called
when KeyKit initially boots or reboots.  KeyKit calls
Rebootfunc() when it reboots, so in order for this function
to be used, the statement "Rebootfunc=normboot" should be
included in keyrc().  Any tasks that must always be
active (for example, the loops that monitor mouse and
console input) should be started here.  To register a
function that will be automatically restarted upon a reboot, 
you should add it to the Rebootfuncs array.
<p>
<dt><b>normexit()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
<p>
<dt><b>normintr()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function is intended to be the default value of Intrfunc,
which KeyKit calls when an interrupt is received, typically
when the user presses the interrupt character on the console.
This function forces a reboot.  If graphics mode is enabled,
an attempt is made to save the current tool configuration
in the file "keydump.lst", which will then be restored after
the reboot.  In this way, a fairly clean restart is performed.
<p>
<dt><b>normredraw()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function is intended to be the default value of Redrawfunc,
which KeyKit calls whenever the screen must be redrawn.
It redraws the root window (i.e. erasing the screen), and
then sends a redraw message to all children windows (i.e. all
the active tools).
<p>
<dt><b>normresize()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function is intended to be the default value of Resizefunc,
which KeyKit calls whenever the screen is resized.  Normally
this function does nothing.  By setting the variable Autoresize
to 1 (e.g. in liblocal/prerc.k), you can cause this function to
automatically resize all the active tools to fit within the new
screen size.
<p>
<dt><b>nrpn(ch,mm,ll)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return an NRPN message constructed from ch (channel, 1-based),
mm (most-significant byte) and ll (least-significant byte).
<p>
<dt><b>nsimul(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return the maximum number of simultaneously-sounding notes in a phrase.
<p>
<dt><b>numquant(number,quantize)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function quantizes the specified number using the specified
quantize value, and returns the result.  The result may be less
than the original number.  If you want to guarantee that the
result is not less than the original (which is typical when you are
quantizing a time value and want to guarantee that the result is
some time in the future), use nextquant().
<p>
<dt><b>onlynotes(ph)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return only the regular notes (non-controller, non-sysex, etc) of ph.
<p>
<dt><b>ornament(ph,orn,doscaleng)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Apply phrase orn to each note of phrase ph - i.e. each note of
phrase ph will be turned into a copy of phrase orn.
If doscaleng is non-zero, then the copy will be scaled to the
duration of the notes in phrase orn.  If doscaleng is zero,
the copy will have the original timing.
<p>
<dt><b>outport(port)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Opena a MIDI output port
<p>
<dt><b>patchunmap_sc8850(p)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
If p is a patch change message, return its entry in the patchmap
Return 0 if it's not a patch message.
<p>
<dt><b>patchunmap_sd80(p)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
If p is a patch change message, return its entry in the patchmap
Return 0 if it's not a patch message.
<p>
<dt><b>pathescape(s)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Takes a file pathname, and returns a version of
the string that can be safely printed to a file and re-read.
<p>
<dt><b>picknote(phrase, n)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Returns n random notes from the specified phrase.  If n is omitted,
a single random note is returned.
<p>
<dt><b>pickphr(phrase1,phrase2,phrase3...)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Randomly chooses and returns one of its argument phrases.
<p>
<dt><b>pitchbend(ch,val)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
 Construct a pitchbend message, where ch is the channel (1-based)
 and val is the pitchbend value, input range is -8192 to 8191.
<p>
<dt><b>pitchlimit(p,p1,p2)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Adjust the pitches of notes in phrase p so that they
fall between p1 and p2, by shifting the notes in octave increments.
<p>
<dt><b>preecho(ph,num,rtime,factor)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
Return phrase ph with each note preceeded by 'pre' echoes.
num is the number of echoes, rtime is the time between them,
and rfactor is the volume factor (between 0.0 and 1.0)
If not provided, rtime and rfactor default to 1b and 0.9
<p>
<dt><b>prelocaldefaults()  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This sets any default values before keylocal.k is called.
<p>
<dt><b>prevquant(number,quantize)  </b><dd>
</listitem>
This function quantizes the specified number using the specified
quantize value, and returns a result that is equal to or less than
