<h2>Introduction</h2>

KeyKit is a programming language and
graphical interface for manipulating and generating music.
This document covers the internals of its multi-window graphic interface,
which is completely implemented in a user-accessible library
of code written in the KeyKit language.  A separate reference manual
describes the language, and this document assumes at least some
familiarity with the language.
<p>
There are two ways to hack KeyKit - modifying the existing tools,
and building new tools.  Building new tools is the best way
that people can share their work, without getting
in each others way.  If everyone started hacking the Riff tool, it would
be difficult to merge all the changes into a single mega-Riff tool,
and the result would be unwieldy.  Individual tools, on the other hand,
can be encapsulated in a single file, are very easy to distribute,
and can be selectively added to the Tools menus.  So, this guide will emphasize
the creation of complete tools, rather than modifying the existing tools.
That said, there will still be some discussion of the typical changes you
might want to make to the existing tools, such as adding new editing
operations to the Group tool.
<h2>MIDI Input and Output</h2>

If you are running on Microsoft Windows (either 95 or NT) and
you have multiple MIDI input or output devices, you may
have to make some adjustments.
By default, KeyKit opens the first MIDI input device it finds, and
opens the MIDIMAPPER for output.  Normally, the choice of MIDIMAPPER will
for output
will be correct, but if you have multiple input devices (e.g. a Soundblaster
card and an MPU-401 that are both configured into your system), you may
find that KeyKit is not using the desired MIDI input device.
To explicitly connect MIDI input to a specific device, you first need
to find out what input ports are available.  Type:
<pre>

listports()
</pre>
and you will see a list of the MIDI input and output ports available.
By default, KeyKit uses input port 0.
To use a different input port (for example, 2), type:
<pre>

inport(2)
</pre>
KeyKit will then be listening to input port number 2.  If you want to make
this change permanent, you should add that statement to your
<b>&#092;keylocal.k</b>
file.
<h2>The Library</h2>

The entire KeyKit user interface is implemented in user-accessible
code in the
<b>lib</b>
directory.  When you add and change things in this source code, you
can immediately use them in a currently-running invocation of KeyKit
by just typing "#include file.k" in a Console window, where file.k is
the name of the file that you have added or changed.  You can redefine
functions on the fly, so the #include of a file will reread and redefine
all of the functions and classes defined in that file.  However, if you
have an instance of a tool on the screen already, and you change the
source code for the tool and then #include the file, the already-existing
instance of the tool will still be using the old tool class definition.
You will need to create a new instance of the tool to test out any changes
to the tool's class.
<p>
The
<font  class="fixed" >keylib.k</font>
file in the lib directory is an index that KeyKit uses to determine the
mapping between functions and the files in which they are defined.
When KeyKit sees a reference to an undefined function, it will look in
<font  class="fixed" >keylib.k</font>
and expect to find an entry for that function.  When you add new functions
to any file in the
<b>lib</b>
directory, you can run the
<b>rereadlib()</b>
function in order to check for updates - if it detects changed files,
it re-read those files and updates
<font  class="fixed" >keylib.k.</font>
Even more easily, you can use the "Misc->Reread Library" item in the main
GUI menu to invoke rereadlib().  If you do a lot of development, tear off
that menu item as a button.
<p>
If you want to create your own directory of library functions, and
use it in addition to the standard library, you can do so by altering
the value of
<b>Keypath,</b>
which is a list of the directories in which KeyKit searches for functions.
Each directory in the Keypath should have its own keylib.k file.
The easiest way of permanently altering the value of Keypath is to
edit
<b>&#092;keylocal.k</b>
and add statements such as this:
<pre>

Keypath = Keypath + ";C:&#092;MYLIBDIR"
rereadlib()
</pre>
to the
<b>keylocal</b>
function.  The call to <b>rereadlib()</b> is needed after any change
to Keypath, and causes all of the
directories to be rescanned for their keylib.k files.
to 
<h2>Methods</h2>

The most recent version of the KeyKit language has explicit support
for objects and methods.  A method is merely an element of an object
that happens to have a function value, making it invokable with
the syntax <b>object.method(</b><i >arguments</i><b>)</b>.  Each KeyKit tool is
defined as an object, and there are by convention certain methods
that tool objects should contain in order to fit into the KeyKit
window interface.  These standard methods are:
<dl>

<dt><b>redraw</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method should completely redraw the tool.
<dt><b>resize(size)</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method makes a request that the
tool resize itself.  The tool doesn't
have to abide by the request - it can adjust the size (for example, to
enforce some minimum or maximum size, or to quantize things by the text size).
This method does <b>not</b> redraw the tool.
The <i >size</i> argument to this method is
an <i >xyarray</i> (see the KeyKit language reference) for the desired tool
size.  It is also possible for this method to be called with no arguments.
In that case, the size of the tool isn't being changed, but the tool is
still being requested to recompute the sizes of things inside the tool.
This is usually only used when the tool reconfigures itself (e.g. when a
new slider is added to a collection of sliders).
<dt><b>dump</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method returns an array representing the current
state of the tool.
The array should contain all the information that a tool needs to
recreate itself.  There are no real constraints on the contents of
the array, although the values must be capable of being printed and
restored by re-reading the printed value - hence function pointer values
are (currently) not allowed in a state array, since function pointers
get printed only as "(&#092;|)".  Saving the name of the function, rather than
its value, is a possible workaround.
<dt><b>restore(state)</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method takes a <i >state</i> array (as
returned by the <b>dump</b> method)
and uses it to restore a tool to its previous state.  This method should
not redraw the tool.
<dt><b>get</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method returns a single data value that
represents the current
value of the tool.  The value is typically a phrase, though this
is not a requirement.
<dt><b>set(value)</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method sets the tool with a
specified <i >value</i>.  The <b>get</b> and
<b>set</b> methods should agree on what constitutes the tool's value.
<dt><b>bang</b><dd>
</listitem>
This method causes the tool to do something.  In the
case of the Riff tool,
it causes the Riff's phrase to be played once.  In the case of the Kboom tool,
it plays the Kboom's pattern once.
</dl>
<h2>Implementing a Tool</h2>

Let's implement a volume slider tool - moving the slider will
send MIDI volume controller messages.
A tool is implemented by providing an object class with
the standard methods described above.
For example:
<pre>

class wvol &#123;
        method init &#123;
                $.w = new window()
                $.inherit($.w)
        &#125;
        method redraw &#123;
                $.w.redraw()
                $.w.text("Hello World",$.w.size())
        &#125;
        method resize (sz) &#123;
                if ( nargs() > 0 )
                        $.w.resize(sz)
        &#125;
&#125;
</pre>
This class is actually complete enough for
a ``Hello World'' tool (see <b>whello.k</b> in the <b>lib</b> directory for
a working copy).  All tools are expected to act like window objects,
with standard window methods such as <b>erase</b> and <b>size</b>.
To get this behaviour, we use the <b>window</b> class and
get a <b>new window()</b> object, from which we inherit all the
normal window methods.
Note that the inheritence is manually specified by calling the
<b>inherit</b> method (one of the few built-in methods
that all objects have).  This means that if someone invokes a method on
our tool object that we haven't explicitly specified (like <b>erase</b>),
the method in the <b>$.w</b> object will be used.
<p>
The example above provides all the functionality for drawing,
resizing, saving, and restoring the tool.  But it doesn't do anything,
and we wanted to build a volume slider.  To do that, we need to make
use of a slider widget:
<pre>

class wvol &#123;
        method init &#123;
                $.w = new window()
                $.inherit($.w)
                # Add a slider widget as a child
                $.slider = new kslider(0,127,120,$,"volchange")
                $.addchild($.slider)
        &#125;
        method redraw &#123;
                $.w.redraw()
                methodbroadcast()
        &#125;
        method resize (sz) &#123;
                if ( nargs() > 0 )
                        $.w.resize(sz)
                $.slider.resize($.w.size())
        &#125;
        method volchange (v) &#123;
                p = controller(1,0x07,v)
                realmidi(p)
        &#125;
&#125;
</pre>
This class now implements a completely functional volume slider.
When an object of class <b>wvol</b> is created, its <b>init</b> method
is called.  In the <b>init</b> method, the <b>kslider</b> class is used
to create a new object whose value is assigned
to <b>$.slider</b>, a new data element in the <b>wvol</b>
object we're in the process of creating.
The name of this data element is not special - we could have called
it <b>$.s</b> if we wanted.  The <b>addchild</b> method (a built-in method
provided for all classes) is used to add this new slider object
to the list of children for the <b>wvol</b> object.  See the KeyKit language
reference manual for a complete description of the children list.
One of the primary uses of the children list is to provide a simple way
to broadcast method invocations.  For example, the <b>methodbroadcast()</b>
function that you see in the <b>redraw</b> method above makes use of this
list -  it broadcasts a method (in this case, <b>redraw</b>)
to all the children of the current object.  We could have explicitly
called <b>$.slider.redraw()</b>, but
<b>methodbroadcast</b> is easier in the long run because most tools have many
children.
<p>
The <b>resize</b> method of our tool resizes both the window
object (<b>$.w</b>) as well as the slider (<b>$.slider</b>).
Note that the size of the slider is set to the size of the window.
In this tool, it probably isn't necessary for the <b>resize</b> method
to handle the situation where no arguments are passed, since that's only
used from within a tool itself, and there are no such uses here.
<p>
The first 3 arguments to <b>kslider()</b> specify that we want a slider whose
values range from 0 to 127, and that the initial value should be 120.
The last 2 arguments to <b>kslider()</b>
control what is done when the slider is moved - they specify an object
and the name of a method (specified as a string value) to be
invoked on that object.  In this case, we're indicating
that we want to invoke the <b>volchange</b> method of the <b>$</b>
object (which is the <b>wvol</b> object being initialized).
So, everytime the slider is moved, it will invoke
<b>$.volchange(</b><i >value</i><b>)</b>, where <i >value</i> is the new value of the
slider.  And you can see that our <b>wvol</b> class includes
the <b>volchange</b> method that will be invoked.  This method takes the
value, produces a volume controller message for channel 1,
and sends it out via MIDI output.  The <b>controller()</b> function can
be found in <b>lib/basic2.k</b> and <b>realtime()</b> is the built-in function
for sending a phrase as raw MIDI output.
<p>
Although the code above is completely functional, it doesn't provide the
ability for the tool to be saved and restored (i.e. when using the <b>Page</b>
feature of the user interface).  This can be provided by adding
the following methods to our <b>wvol</b> class:
<pre>

        method get &#123; return($.slider.get()) &#125;
        method set (v) &#123; return($.slider.set(v)) &#125;
        method dump &#123; return(["value"=string($.get())]) &#125;
        method restore (state) &#123; $.set(state["value"]) &#125;
</pre>
The first two methods are the standard methods which get and set the
tool's value.  In this case, the value of the tool is just the value of
the slider, so we merely make use of the slider object's <b>get</b> and
<b>set</b> methods.
<p>
The <b>dump</b> method returns an array with 1 element.  The index of
the array element is <b>"value"</b>, and the value of the array element
is <b>$.get()</b> converted
to a string.  (Note that <b>$.get()</b> actually results in a call
to <b>$.slider.get()</b>.)  For example, if the value of the slider was
120, the array returned by the <b>dump</b> method would
be <b>["value"=120]</b>.  This would be the array given back
to <b>$.restore()</b> when the tool was restored.  And, <b>$.restore()</b>
merely takes the value out of the array and gives it to <b>$.set()</b>.
<p>
As you can see, it is very common for methods of a tool to reference other
methods of the same object.  This should be the preferred way of working.
Even though the <b>$.dump()</b> statement above could call <b>$.slider.get()</b>
directly, it should not.  That way, future changes to the way in which
the value of the tool is obtained can be made in a single place,
in <b>$.get()</b>.
<h2>Documenting a Tool</h2>

Documentation for each tool is stored in a separate .xml
file in the
<b>lib</b>
directory.  For example, the source code for the Volume tool is in
<b>wvol.k</b>
and its documentation is in
<b>wvol.xml,</b>
and both files are in the
<b>lib</b>
directory.
All of the .xml files are converted by a script to .html files.
<p>
<h2>Widgets</h2>

The <b>kslider</b> used above is an example of a widget that can be used
in the construction of tools.  To be honest, there is no real
difference between a widget and a tool.  In fact, a tool (such as the
volume slider we just created) can easily be used
within other tools - the <b>Bounce</b> tool is an example which uses
4 <b>Riff</b> tools.  The word widget, however, is reserved for small
things like buttons and sliders that are not intended to be
used standalone.  Here is a list of the current widgets:
<dl>

<dt>kbutton<dd>
</listitem>
This is a simple button.  You can control what gets drawn inside
the button, and you can control whether the action gets done on the
mousedown or mouseup event.
<dt>kmenubutton<dd>
</listitem>
This is a button that, when pressed, triggers a named
pop-up menu.
<dt>kslider<dd>
</listitem>
This is a slider.
<dt>ktext<dd>
</listitem>
This is raw text, centered.
<dt>ktoggle<dd>
</listitem>
This is a toggle button, whose value alternates between 0 and 1.
When the value is 1, its display is inverted.
<dt>krubber<dd>
</listitem>
This is a button that allows you to drag a line and get notified of
the object over which it is released.  This is only used in
the <b>Bang</b> tool.
<dt>kmsg<dd>
</listitem>
This is text which is meant to be displayed momentarily - it
saves a bitmap of what's underneath the text (before initial display),
and when the kmsg widget is deleted, it restores the bitmap (so that
it's unnecessary to redraw anything that's underneath).
<dt>kvalbutton<dd>
</listitem>
This is like a menubutton, except that you give it a list
of values, and when the button is pressed the values are used to construct
the pop-up menu.  The values can be changed dynamically, after the
widget is initially created.
</dl>
<h2>The Group Tool</h2>

The <b>Group</b> tool is the largest tool by far, both in code size
(several thousand lines so far) and capability.  As with all the other
tools, complete source code is contained in the <b>lib</b> directory.
Its internal implementation is fairly messy, and you
should definitely not use its code as an example of how to
write a KeyKit tool.  Still, there are features of the Group tool
that you may want to customize.  In particular, you may want to add
a new editing function, so here are instructions on how to do that.
<p>
Let's say you want to add a <b>Slowdown</b> command to the <b>Edit</b> menu
that allows you to apply the following function to the current <b>Pick</b>:
<pre>

function slowdown(ph) &#123;
        tm1 = ph%1.time
        sz = sizeof(ph)
        leng = phz.time + phz.dur - tm1
        start_factor = 1.0
        end_factor = 4.0
        df = end_factor - start_factor
        r = nonnotes(ph)
        ph = onlynotes(ph)
        for ( nt in ph ) &#123;
                dt = nt.time - tm1
                thisfactor = start_factor + (dt/float(leng)) * df
                nt.time = tm1 + dt * thisfactor
                nt.dur *= thisfactor
                r |= nt
        &#125;
        return(r)
&#125;
</pre>
This function implements a gradual slowing
down by adjusting the time and duration of the
notes.  First, put this function into a file in the <b>lib</b> directory,
and run the <b>rereadlib()</b> function which updates the <b>keylib.k</b> index file.
<p>
Now, edit <b>lib/mkmenus.k</b> and find the <b>mkmenu_edit</b> function.
Add the following line to that function, wherever you want it to appear
in the <b>Edit</b> menu (presumably after <b>Shuffle</b>,
to make it alphabetical):
<pre>

o.menucmd("Slowdown",po,"edit","cmd_slowdown")
</pre>
Now, edit <b>lib/cmds.k</b>, and add the following function:
<pre>

function cmd_slowdown(p) &#123;
        return(slowdown(p))
&#125;
</pre>
You should now be able to see a <b>Slowdown</b> item in the <b>Edit</b> menu
of the <b>Group</b> tool, and should be able to invoke it and see the
effect on whatever notes you have picked.
<h2>Other Tool Modifications</h2>

You may wish to make minor tweaks to some of the menus and settings in some
of the tools.  You can often make such changes without having to
understand how the tools are implemented.
<p>
For example, the
<b># of Steps</b> menu in the <b>Kboom</b>
tool currently only goes up to 32 steps, but there's really no limit in the
implementation of <b>Kboom</b> other than the fact that the menu is
initialized with values from 2 to 32.  Take a look at the source
code for the <b>Kboom</b> tool, in <b>lib/wkboom.k</b>, and look for
a 32.  Change it to 64.  You can now create drum patterns with 64 steps.
<p>
Another example - the <b>Riff</b> tool has a <b>Start Quant</b> menu with
values that go from <b>None</b> to <b>8b</b>.  Let's say you want to add
<b>16b</b> to that
list.  Take a look at the source code, in <b>lib/wriff.k</b>.  Look for
a line that has <b>8b</b> in it.  Add another line that looks
just like it, except substitute <b>16b</b> for the two ocurrences of <b>8b</b>.
You're done, and so is this document.
