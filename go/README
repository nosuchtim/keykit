These are miscellaneous comments on the KeyKit source code.
You should only be interested in this stuff if the top-level
makefile fails in some way, or if you're porting KeyKit to
a new machine or environment.

The "protoflp" program is used to flip the KeyKit source between
two states: 1) using prototype function declarations and definitions,
and 2) not using them.  KeyKit should normally be distributed with
prototype declarations turned off, since this is the most portable.
If you (or your compiler) want to use prototypes, all you have to do is
edit the makefile to set PROTO=-p, then run "make protoproc"
(which will run protoflp on each source file).   Similarly, if
the KeyKit source you have is set up to use prototypes, and your
compiler can't handle them, you can flip it back to not using
prototypes by setting PROTO=-n and running "make protoproc".

The d_*.h files contain external function declarations that are
automatically generated by protoflp.

When working on the graphics functions for a new machine or environment,
you should make use of the ptest1, ptest2, and ptest3 test programs to
exercise them.
