			KEYKIT 4.1 FOR AMIGA
			    April 4, 1990


KeyKit will run on any Amiga with at least 1 meg of RAM and a MIDI
interface.  A hard disk or 2 floppy disk drives is strongly recommended.
No additional software other than Workbench is required (previous versions
of keykit used arp.library, but that is no longer required).

Disk 1 contains the keykit executables, library functions, formatted
documentation, and a few amiga-specific files.  Disk 2 contains an
extensive collection of keykit music.

On a hard disk system, copy disk 1 to an appropriate place on the hard
disk, copy disk 2 to the "music" sub-directory, and assign keykit: to
the directory where you copied disk 1.  On a floppy-only system, you will
need to edit the lib/keykit.rc file on disk 1 and change any occurrances
of "keykit:music" to "keymusic:".

KeyKit should be run from a CLI or shell.  If ConMan or NEWCON are
installed, command line editing and history will be available in the CLI
window.  Editing and history are not available in graphics mode.

Before running keykit, add keykit:bin to your path and use "stack 30000"
to set the stack.  Documentation is in the keykit:fmt directory.  You
should start by reading keytutor.doc.

All of keykit's capabilities are available on the Amiga, with the
exception of pipes (if anyone has an Amiga version of popen/pclose that
actually works, please let me know).  Some of the library functions may
contain commands specific to other machines, and may have to be modified
to work on the Amiga.  One such file that has been changed is readinit.k.

You can customize the screen resolution and number of colors used in
graphics mode by setting the following variables:

	Graphmode = 0		Open a 640x200 non-interlaced screen.

	Graphmode = 1		Open a 640x400 interlaced screen (default).

	Colors = 2,4,8,16	The Colors variable defines how many
				colors keykit can use (default is 4).

If you're short on memory, use the lower resolution screen or fewer
colors, or both.

Holding the left-amiga key will reveal the screen title bar and the
standard screen manipulation gadgets.  While in graphics mode, output
from the system() function will appear in the original CLI window
rather than on the graphics screen.  Use the screen manipulation gadgets
or the left-amiga M and N keys to move between screens.

Direct your Amiga-specific comments, questions, and bug reports to me,
and have fun!
