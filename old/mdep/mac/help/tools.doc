.H1 "Introduction" intro tools:01
KeyKit is a programming language and
graphical interface for manipulating and generating music.
This reference manual lists the individual tools and menus in the
user interface.  All of these tools and menus are implemented with
code in the
.B lib
directory.  Since the tools are so easy to change,
the descriptions here may not be completely up to date, but they should
be pretty close.
.SP
If you are just getting started with KeyKit, this is not the first
document you should be reading.
.ne 0.5i
.He
.H1 "Apply" wapply tools:02
The
.B Apply
tool is a utility for taking multiple phrases and applying their attributes
to some target phrase.
The
.B PH1 ,
.B PH2 ,
.B PH3 ,
and
.B PH4
buttons let you read four phrases (either from Standard MID Files, or
from the Snarf).  The
.B Apply
button lets you load the target phrase (from Standard MIDI Files, or from
one of the other four phrases).  The
.B Apply 
button then is used to apply the attributes
(such as pitch, duration, or timing) from the other phrases to this target
phrase.
.H1 "Bang" wbang tools:02
The
.B Bang
tool is a utility for sending messages to other tools.
The
.B Add
and
.B Del
buttons are used to add and delete connections between the Bang tool
and other tools.  To make a connection, press and hold the mouse on the
.B Add
button, and drag the mouse away.  You will see a line stretching as you
drag the mouse.  Drag the line so that it ends up on the desired tool,
and release the mouse.  The connection is now made.  To check the connection,
press the
.B Add
button - all of the current connections will be displayed until you release
the button.  The
.B Del
button is used just like the
.B Add
button, except that it removes connections - you drag the line to the
tool whose connection you want to delete.
.SP
Pressing the
.B Bang
button will cause the Bang tool to send a message to all of the connected
tools.  The default message is "bang".  In essence, this will invoke the
.B bang
method in each of the connected tools.
If a tool does not have a
.B bang
method, a warning message will be printed in the console window.
.SP
The
.B More
menu lets you set things up so that the Bang tool will monitor MIDI
input and trigger itself automatically when a particular MIDI message is seen.
To set up this capability, you should first play on your MIDI input
device the desired MIDI message (e.g. a particular note on your keyboard).
Then, invoke the
.B "Load Recorded"
menu item in the
.B More
menu.  This will load the MIDI message that you just played.  To have the
Bang tool then continuously monitor MIDI input for this message,
press the
.B On
button.  This button is a toggle - pressing it again will turn it off.
When the Bang tool is
.B On,
all MIDI input is monitored, and each occurrence of the
specified MIDI message will cause the Bang tool to trigger and send a
message to all of its connections.
.SP
You can change the message that the Bang tool sends by invoking
the
.B "Set Message"
item in the
.B More
menu.  After invoking it, you will see a window in which you can enter
the message name.  The
.B "Set Comment"
item lets you change the text that is displayed in the center of the Bang
tool.  The
.B "Delete ALL Trigees"
item will remove all of the Bang tool's connections.
.H1 "Blocks" wblocks tools:02
The
.B Blocks
tool lets you manipulate a linear sequence of phrases (blocks).  Each phrase
in the sequence comes from a "phrase collection".  The original intended
use of this tool was for manipulating drum patterns, but it can
be used for sequencing any type of phrase, including complete songs.
.SP
The default number of blocks is 4, but the button that is labelled "4"
is actually a menu that lets you set the number of blocks.
.SP
The
.B "Read Collection"
item in the
.B More
menu lets you read in a "collection" file - these files have a
.CW ".kc"
suffix by convention.  In your
.B lib
directory you should find a file named
.B drums1.kc
which you can use - it contains a variety of simple drum patterns.
After reading a collection, you will then find that the button menus above
each "block" (whose labels will initially read "One beat") will contain
a list of names.  By pressing the button menu above a particular
block and selecting one of these names, the corresponding drum pattern
will be placed in that block.
.SP
To play the patterns you've placed in the blocks, press the
left mouse button within one of the blocks (the phrase window part).
Playback will begin in the block you've selected and continue to the
right, ending at the rightmost block.  If you press the
.B Loop
button (which is a toggle), it will cause the playback to loop continuously.
Pressing the left mouse button in any of the phrase windows will terminate
the playback of the blocks.
.SP
Creating a new collection is also done with the
.B Blocks
tool.  To clear the current collection, use
the
.B "Clear Collection"
item in the
.B More
menu.
To add a phrase to the collection, you first assign the
desired phrase to the current Snarf (using the "Snarf" item you'll find in
most tools).  Then, invoke the
.B "Add Snarf to Collection"
item in the
.B More
menu.
You will be requested to enter the name you want to assign to the phrase.
This name will be added to the list in the menu button above each
block, and you can use it like any other phrase in the collection.
When you've added a number of new phrases to the collection, you can write
the new collection to a file by using the
.B "Write Collection"
item in the
.B More
menu.
.SP
When creating a collection of drum patterns, you'll want to make
sure the length of each phrase is quantized.  If you Snarf the current Pick
in the Group tool, the length will not be quantized.  The better way to
grab a phrase (in the Group tool) for use in a Blocks collection is to
use the
.B "Snarf->Aud"
item you'll find in the track menus of the Group tool.  By Snarfing
the Audition area, the length of the Snarf will be the exact length of
the Audition area, and you can then make sure it has the desired length.
.SP
The
.B "Start Quant->" 
item in the
.B More
menu lets you control the quantization of the start time, whenever
the blocks are played.
.SP
If you create a set of blocks that you like, you can use the
.B "Snarf All"
item in the
.B More
menu to Snarf the entire sequence, which you can then read into
(for example) a Group tool for editing and other use.
.H1 "Bounce" wbounce tools:02
The
.B Bounce
tools is an odd toy.  It consists of four
.B Riff
tools surrounding a bouncing line.  Press the 
.B On
toggle button to turn the bouncing line on and off.  You won't hear anything
initially because there's nothing in any of the Riff
tools.  Put a phrase into one of the Riff tools - see the documentation on
the Riff tool for instructions on how to do that.
Then start the bouncing line.  Each time the line touches the side of that
Riff tool, it will send a
.B bang
message to the Riff tool, causing it to play its phrase.
.SP
You'll normally want to put simple phrases (chords, or drum beats)
into each Riff tool.  The
.B "Chord Palette"
tool is a good way of generating (and Snarfing) chords that can then
be placed in each Riff tool.  Or you can just play something on your
MIDI input device and use the
.B "Load Rec"
item in the Riff tool to grab and use it.
.SP
You'll very likely want to use the
.B "Start Quant->"
item in the Riff tool to quantize the start time of each of the
four Riffs that the Bounce tool is playing.
.SP
The
.B Speed
slider can be used to adjust the speed of the bouncing line.
.H1 "Chord Palette" wchord tools:02
The
.B "Chord Palette"
tool presents a matrix of cells that let you play (and Snarf) chords.
Pressing the mouse button in a given cell will play a chord and automatically
place it into the Snarf.  The rows of the matrix are labelled with the
chord types (major, minor, etc.), and the columns are labelled with
the chord keys (C,C#,D,etc.).
.SP
If the size of the window is too small, the column labels may be truncated.
Resizing the window so it's larger will reveal the full labels.
.SP
The
.B "Octave->"
item in the
.B More
menu lets you control the octave of the played chords - the default is
octave 3.
.SP
The
.B "Mode->"
item in the
.B More
menu lets you control whether the chords are played, automatically put
into the Snarf, or both.  The default is to do both.
.H1 "Comment" wcomment tools:02
The
.B Comment
tool lets you place arbitrary text on the screen.  When you first place
the Comment tool, it contains the string "Comment...".  To change the text,
press the left mouse button on the tool.  You will be asked to enter the
new text.
.SP
The
.B Comment
tool automatically resizes itself to fit the text it contains.  Even if you
explicitly resize it to a larger size, the resulting size of the Comment
tools will still be just enough to fit the text.
.SP
The
.B Comment
tool is very crude.  It is limited to a single line of text.
.H1 "Console" wconsole tools:02
The
.B Console
tool creates a new interactive interpreter in which you can type Keynote
statements and have them executed.  You can have multiple Console
tools on the screen simultaneously, though only one of them is the
current Console, on which the output of
.B print
statements will appear, and to which keypresses are directed.
If you create a new Console tool, it immediately becomes the current Console.
Pressing the left mouse button within a Console tool causes it to become
the current Console - this is the way you can switch between several
Console windows.
.SP
The scroll bar on the left side of the Console tool can be used to
scroll backwards and forwards through its displayed text.
The special variable
.B Textscrollsize
controls how many lines are available in the Console tool.  The default
value is 200, although you can change this in your
.B prerc
function.
.H1 "Controller" wcontrol tools:02
The
.B Controller
tool lets you generate MIDI controller messages, such as volume and pan.
There are sixteen sliders, each corresponding to one of the
sixteen MIDI channels.  Moving a slider will generate messages on that channel.
The menu button in the upper-left corner lets you specify
which type of message is generated.  Some of the message types (for
example, "reverb depth") are specific to General MIDI devices.
.SP
The
.B Send
button, when pressed, will send the current controller values (as specified
by the current settings of the 16 sliders) to MIDI output.  The
.B Snarf
button will take all of these messages and, rather than sending them to
MIDI output, put them in the Snarf buffer.
.H1 "Echo" wecho tools:02
The
.B Echo
tool is a realtime utility.  When you turn it
.B On
(the
.B On
button is a toggle switch), all MIDI input will be echoed to MIDI output.
The default settings will echo each MIDI input note with a delay time
of one beat, but you can control the delay and other factors by moving
the sliders.  The
.B time
slider controls the delay time between echos.  The
.B trans
slider controls the pitch transposition of each echo.  For example, if the
.B trans
slider is set to 7, then the echoed notes will be transposed 7 steps up
(i.e. a fifth).  Likewise, a value of -7 will transpose a fifth down.
.SP
The
.B vol
slider controls the volume decay.  For example, if it is set to 50%, then the
volume of each echoed note will be decreased by 50 percent.
.SP
The
.B ntimes
slider controls how many echoes are generated.  For example, if it is
set to 4, then each input MIDI note will be echoed 4 times.  If the
.B vol
slider was set to 50%, the volume of the 4th echo would be 1/16 the volume
of the initial note.  Also, if the
.B trans
slider was set to 2, then the pitch of the 4th echo would be 8 steps
above the original note.
.SP
Since Keynote is multi-tasking, it is possible (and great fun) to create
multiple
.B Echo
tools and have them operating simultaneously, with different settings in each.
.SP
There is also an
.B EchoInfinite
tool that works just like the Echo tool, but which echoes forever
(or until each note's volume reaches 0).
.H1 "Grab Bag" wgrabbag tools:02
The
.B Grab Bag
tool is too complicated for me to explain completely at this
point, but I'll describe one
way to get interesting things out of it.  Assuming you have a
General MIDI synth, use the More menu button and invoke
More->Fill All->GM drums(4b).  You should see the cells of the
grid fill with randomly generated drum patterns.  Press the Walk
toggle button, and it will start playing the cells of the grid,
walking from one to the next.  Press the Walk toggle button again
to turn it off.
.SP
Do the same thing with More->Fill All->BS Riff(4b) and it will fill
the cells with melodic patterns.
.SP
Put multiple Grab Bag tools on the screen and start them simultaneously.
There are menu items to let you control the grid size, the starttime
quantization, etc.
.SP
There is a value button at the top that lets you set the MIDI
channel (except for drums).
The slider on the left controls volume, and the slider on the right
controls how many notes of each pattern are included.
.H1 "Group" wgroup tools:02
The
.B Group
tool is very much like a standard multi-track sequencer.
It allows flexible editing of music, and is the most important (and largest)
tool provided in the user interface of Keynote.
.SP
The
.B Read
item in the
.B File
menu lets you read things into the Group tool.
For example, the
.B "Read->Standard MIDI File"
item will prompt you for the name of a Standard MIDI File.
.B "Read->Snarf"
will load the Group tool with the current contents of the Snarf buffer.
.B "Read->Recorded"
will load the Group tool by looking at the
.B Recorded
variable, which records MIDI input.  If you choose the
.B "(2b space)"
variation of this item, the Recorded MIDI input will be searched backwards
until a two-beat space is located, and all MIDI input from that
point forward will be grabbed and loaded into the Group tool.
Likewise for the
.B "(8b space)"
variation, except that it looks for an eight-beat space.
.SP
The Group tool maintains a set of tracks.  The merged contents of
all tracks is always displayed in the track named
.B Merged.
The
.B View->Tracks
menu item controls what tracks are displayed.
For example, selecting
.B View->Tracks->All
will cause all tracks to be displayed.
Other items in the
.B View
menu control the region (time-wise) of the music that is displayed.
For example,
.B View->In
lets you zoom in to get more detail.
After invoking
.B View->In,
you are expected to sweep out an area within one of
the tracks in the Group tool.
The mouse cursor will change to a left-right arrow, to give you
a reminder that you are expected to sweep out a horizontal area.
The area you sweep out will then fill the display.
.SP
The
.B View->Pan
item lets you move left and right within the phrase.  After invoking
.B View->Pan,
you are then expected to press the left mouse button and drag the mouse.
You will see the phrase within the Group tool move left and right as
you drag the mouse left and right.
.SP
New tracks can be added with the
.B "File->Add Track"
menu.  For example, a new blank track can be added with
.B "File->Add Track->Blank."
If you play back some part of the music in the Group tool, and
play something along with it on your MIDI input device,
you will often want to add your overdubbed input as a new track.
This is done with with
.B "File->Add Track->Last Overdub."
Note that you don't have to do anything in preparation for adding an
Overdub track.  Every time you play back something in the Group tool,
Keynote is recording MIDI input, and if you happen to play something
you like, you can immediatly save it as a new track.
.SP
At the upper-left corner
of each track (including the merged track) is a menu button, and the
menu it reveals is called the
.B "track menu."
The
items in a track menu apply only to the corresponding track.
For example, the
.B Unshow
item in the track menu will cause that
track to be removed from the display (though it still exists, and its
music will still be shown in the
Merged
track.  The
.B Showonly
item will cause only that track to be display (in addition to the
Merged
track, which is always shown.  If you want to go back to seeing only
the
Merged
track, select
.B Showonly
in the track menu for
the
Merged
track.
.SP
The text within the track menu buttons are the track names.
You can change a track name by using the
.B Label
item in the track menu.
.SP
Within each track window, the 2 mouse buttons (left and right) are used
for a variety of operations.  Instead of being fixed, the
meaning of each mouse button can be changed, and in practice you should
expect to change their meanings often.
The meanings of the mouse buttons are assigned with the 3 menu buttons
in the upper-right corner of the Group tool.
Each mouse button actually has three meanings - one when the
shift key is pressed, one when the control key is pressed, and one when
no keys are pressed.
The keys that can modify the mouse button meanings are called "modifiers".
The leftmost of the 3 menu buttons in the upper right corner of the
Group tool controls the "modifier" that currently applies
to the other two menu buttons - the modifier value can be
.B Normal,
.B Shift,
or
.B Control.
When the modifier is set to
.B Shift,
then the other two menu buttons will control the meanings of the left and right
mouse buttons when the Shift key is pressed.  Likewise, when the modifier
is set to
.B Control,
then the other two menu buttons control the meanings of the mouse buttons
when the Control key is pressed.  And when the modifier
is set to
.B Normal,
then the other two menu buttons control the meanings of the mouse buttons
when no key is pressed.
The label of each button reveals the current meaning
of that mouse button (for the current modifier setting).
To change the operation of a button, you select the
operation you want from the corresponding mouse button menu, and from
then on that mouse button (combined with the appropriate modifier)
will perform that operation.
.SP
The default operation for the left mouse button, when a Group tool is
first created, is
.B "Aud Sweep"
(where
.B Aud
is short
for
.B Audition
).
This means that when you press and drag the left mouse button within a track
window, you will be sweeping out the audition area.  Try it, making sure
that the mouse is within a track window when you start sweeping.  While you
sweep, you will see vertical bars that indicate the audition area.  When
you release, there is no visible indication of the current audition area
(though someday there probably should be).  The default operation
for the right mouse button is
.B "Aud Play"
- to play the current
audition area.
So, if you use the left mouse button to sweep some part of the music,
and then press the right mouse button, you should hear that music
played via MIDI output, and you should see the notes flash as they play.
To stop the playback, press the right mouse button again.  This shows that
.B "Aud Play"
is a toggle - it starts and stops playback.
.SP
Now, try changing the meaning of the left mouse button.  Use the
menu button labeled
.B L:,
and select
.B Pick->Sweep.
From then on, the left mouse button
will sweep out the current
.B Pick.
The term Pick refers to the
selected notes of the music that will be affected whenever an Edit operation
is used.  Try using the left mouse button to sweep an area of the music.
After you sweep, you should see the notes in that area turn red.  The notes
of the current Pick are always drawn in red.
.SP
The
.B View->In
menu item lets you zoom in to get a closer look at the
music.  After you select this item, the mouse cursor will change to
a left-right arrow, meaning that you are then expected to sweep out an
area within one of the tracks.  Do this.  You should see the display redrawn
with that area of the track filling the display.  Note that
.B View->In
changes the meaning of the left mouse button only temporarily - it then
reverts to the operation specified in the
.B L:
menu button.
.B View->Out
will return to viewing the entire piece of music.
.SP
Zoom in on part of the music, so that you can easily see individual notes.
Pick a few notes (i.e.
make sure the left mouse button is set to
.B Pick->Sweep,
and then sweep the notes).
Now, select
.B Edit->Delete,
and the notes in
the current Pick will be removed.
Do it again - pick some more notes and delete them.
Now, select
.B Edit->Undo.
You will see your last deletion undone.
Select
.B Edit->Undo
again, and you will see your first deletion undone,
so your music is back to its original state.  The
.B Undo
operation can
undo the last 32 editing operations, by default, and you can easily increase
this number, subject to memory limitations.
.SP
The
.B Edit->Undo
item is one of the most common menu items to pull off
and make into a real button.  It's important to realize that when you do this,
that
.B Undo
button will only affect the Group tool from which you
pulled it - it will not affect any other Group tools that are on the screen.
This is true of any of the buttons that you pull from menus in any
given tool.  There is currently no visible or other indication of the
relationship between pulled-off buttons and the tools they control,
so it's obviously a good idea to position the buttons
in ways that make it obvious as to which tool they belong.
.H1 "Kboom" wkboom tools:02
The
.B Kboom
tool is a drum pattern editor that has taken on a life of
its own - it has a lot of features that are a lot of fun to play with.
It displays a grid where each row represents a drum and each column
represents a step.
The drums, however, are not restricted to single notes that trigger
drum sounds.  A "drum" can be set to an arbitrary MIDI message,
or even a complete phrase.  New drums can be added and set on the fly,
while the pattern is playing.
.SP
The menu button at the left end of each row will reveal a list of
drums.  The default drum list is appropriate for a General MIDI synthesizer,
but if you want you can change this list by editing the
.CW lib/maps.k
file as appropriate for your situation.
.SP
To use an arbitrary MIDI note as a drum, just play the note on your
MIDI input device, and then invoke the
.B "Use Rec'd Note/Chord"
item in the menu button for one of the rows.  From then on, cells in that
row will trigger the note that you just played.  The same method can be
used to set the drum to a complete chord rather than a note.  In essence,
all notes that overlap the last-played note will be grabbed and used
as the drum.  If you want to use a phrase (i.e. several notes in sequence),
just play the phrase on your MIDI input device and then invoke
.B "Use Rec'd Phrase"
in the drum's menu button.  This will look backwards in time for the
first two-beat space - everything played after that space will be
taken as the "phrase" that will be used for that drum.
Another way to set a drum note is to invoke
.B "Use Snarf,"
in which case the current contents of the Snarf buffer will be used.
.SP
When you set a drum value using MIDI input or via the Snarf buffer,
the label on the drum button will show a "constant phrase" representation
of the value.  To change this label, invoke the
.B "Set Label"
item in the drum button menu.  You will be prompted to enter the text
for a new label.
.SP
The
.B More
menu in the Kboom tool controls a variety of things.  The
.B Snarf
item will grab a copy of the current drum pattern and put it into the
Snarf buffer (for use in other tools).  The
.B Clear
item will clear all of the cells in the drum grid.
The
.B "Read Drumkit"
menu item will read a file that initializes the drum set.
An example of the file that
.B "Read Drumkit"
uses can be found in the
.CW lib\*(Esdrums.kbm
file - it is an ASCII file that specifies the channel, pitches, and labels
for the drums.  You can use a text editor to create other such files,
making it easy to use a particular set of drums without having to
set them up manually with the drum buttons.
.SP
The
.B Flash
item lets you turn off the flashing indication of the current beat
at the top of the Kboom tool.  Turning it off may be appropriate if
you have a slow machine, or if there is just too much activity on
your screen.
.SP
Instead of having each step be
just on and off, you can use
.B "More->Toggle Mode->Gradual"
to turn 
on a mode in which each cell can be filled in gradually.  If a cell is filled
in 25% of the way, then that "hit" of the drum will only occur
25% (randomly) of the time.  This can add variety to a pattern.
Another way of adding variety is to create a second
.B Kboom
tool with
a different number of steps, and playing the two patterns at the same
time.
.SP
The
.B "# of Drums ->"
and
.B "# of Steps ->"
items in the
.B More
menu let you change the number of rows and columns in the grid.
The
.B "Shift ->"
item lets you shift the entire contents of the grid, forward and backward.
The shift is done in a circular fashion, so no drum hits are actually lost.
.H1 "Markov Maker" wmark tools:02
The
.B "Markov Maker"
tool lets you create music with markov-chain techniques.
The top phrase window displays some existing piece of music that you read in,
and the bottom phrase window display a "similar" piece of music
that is created by the
.B "Markov Maker."
.SP
First, use the
.B "Read->File"
item of the
.B Orig
menu to read in a piece of music.  (Try one of the Bach pieces in the
.B music
directory.)
.SP
Then use the nested menus under
.B "Orig->Set Sim"
to initialize the
Markov model of the music.  You can experiment with the values, but
for good initial results, try
.B "Win 1b/2"
and
.B "Inc 1b/4."
The
.B Win
value is the "window" that is
swept across the phrase, and the
.B Inc
value is the increment by which
the window is moved across the phrase.  (See the source code
in
.CW lib/setsim.k
for more details.)
.SP
Now, use the
.B "Sim->Make Sim->"
menu to select the size of the "similar" phrase that you want to generate.
Pressing the mouse button inside either phrase window will start
(and stop) its playing.
You can use
.B Sim->Snarf
to grab the generated phrase and then
(for example) read it it into a
.B Group
tool for further editing.
.SP
The
.B "Markov Maker"
tool is perhaps the easiest thing to impress
people with.  As an example, use
.CW music/prelude.mid
as the music,
and
.B "Win 1b/2"
and
.B "Inc 1b/4"
as the values, and generate a fairly
long piece.  It's surprising how interesting the results are.
.H1 "Mouse Matrix" wmatrix tools:02
The
.B "Mouse Matrix"
tool is an interactive toy.  Each cell of the grid it displays contains
a different chord.  Pressing the left mouse button within a cell
plays its chord.  Dragging the mouse (while its button is pressed)
across the grid generates interesting sounds.
.SP
The left mouse button plays notes on channel 1, by default.
The right mouse button plays notes on channel 10, by default, which is
the drum channel of General MIDI synthesizers.  You can change these
two defaults by setting the values of the
.B Mmchan1
and
.B Mmchan2
variables - either interactively, by typing in the Console window,
or by putting statements into your
.B prerc
function.
.SP
For each cell, four notes are played as a chord.  You can change the number
of notes in the chord by setting the
.B Mmsize
variable (again, interactively or in
.B prerc
).  Valid values for
.B Mmsize
are 4, 3, 2 and 1.
For example, typing
.B Mmsize=1
in the Console window would cause the
.B "Mouse Matrix"
tool to produce single notes for each cell.
.H1 "Parameters" wparam tools:02
The
.B Parameters
tool lets you set values for various global parameters.
The left button is a menu for selecting the parameter, and the right
button is a menu for selecting the parameter's value.
.SP
The
.B Autoresize
parameter, when on, causes tools to automatically resize themselves when
the main Keynote window is resized.  For example, if you enlarge the main
Keynote window, the size of all tools will be enlarged proportionately.
.SP
The
.B Dragquant
parameters controls the quantization of the
.B Drag
operation in the Group tool.
.SP
The
.B Menujump
parameter affects the operation of menu scroll bars.  When this parameter
is on, the scroll bar will immediately jump to the mouse position when the
mouse enters the scroll bar.
.SP
The
.B Merge
parameter controls whether MIDI input is automatically merged into
MIDI output.  If you have a MIDI keyboard connected directly to the
input of your computer, and your synthesizer modules are connected directly
to the output of your computer, then you would want the Merge value
to be On (the default value), so that notes you played on the
MIDI keyboard would be sent to the MIDI synthesizers.
If, on the other hand, you have your routing of MIDI cables set up so that
messages from your MIDI keyboard are already reaching your synthesizers,
then you would not want Keynote to Merge MIDI input with MIDI output,
and you would set the Merge parameter value to Off.
.SP
The
.B Record
parameter, when on, causes all MIDI input to be added to the value of the
.B Recorded
phrase.
.SP
The
.B Recsched
parameter controls whether MIDI data that is generated by Keynote will
be recorded in the
.B Recorded
variable.  Normally, only MIDI input is saved in the
.B Recorded
variable which is used, for example, when you use the
.B "Load Rec"
item in the Riff tool to load something you've just played on MIDI input.
Sometimes, you want to record the output that Keynote is generating
(for example, when you're playing with the Mouse Matrix tool).
By turning the
.B Recsched
parameter on, all generated MIDI output will be saved (along with MIDI input)
in the
.B Recorded
variable, and you can then load it into a tool for further editing.
You should only turn on
.B Recsched
for relatively short periods of time, since if you leave it on all the time,
the Recorded phrase will accumulated everything you play back.
.SP
The
.B Sweepquant
parameter controls the quantization of sweeping within the Group
tool (and any other tool that involves sweeping within a phrase window).
For example, if you wanted to sweep out Pick phrases and you wanted to
only use complete measures, you could set the Sweepquant value
to
.B Whole.
From then on, when sweeping within a phrase window, the vertical sweep bars
would only move in whole-note increments.
.SP
The
.B Volstem
parameter controls whether volume stems are displayed on notes within
phrase windows.
Volume stems are vertical lines at the front of each note.  The vertical
size of the line represents the relative volume of each note.  You can
also set (manually) the special variable
.B Volstemsize
to control the scaling of the volume stem lines.
.H1 "Prog Change" wprogch tools:02
The
.B Prog Change
tool lets you generate program change messages.  There is a separate menu
button for each of the 16 MIDI channels.
When you press these buttons, you will see the General MIDI patch list.
When you select a patch from the list, the appropriate program change
message will be transmitted on MIDI output.
.SP
Although the default list of patches is intended for use with General MIDI
synthesizers, you can change the list of patches by editing the
.CW lib/maps.k
file (there are comments in that file that explain what to do).
The functions in
.CW maps.k
are used by several Keynote tools (e.g. the
.B Group
and
.B Kboom
tools also use the program and drum maps specified there).
.H1 "Riff" wriff tools:02
The
.B Riff
tool is a simple utility for playing and recording phrases.
It has no real editing functions - that role is filled by the
.B Group
tool.  The Riff tool is useful for looping phrases (repeating them
endlessly), and is often used as a target of the
.B Bang
tool.
.SP
The
.B "Load Rec"
item in the
.B More
menu will load the Riff tool with the most recently recorded MIDI input.
If you select
.B "Load Rec (1b space),"
it will look back in time to find the first one-beat space, and will
load the Riff tool with all MIDI input recorded after that.  The
.B "Load Rec (4b space)"
does the same thing except it looks for a four-beat space.
The
.B "Load From Snarf"
and
.B "Load from File"
items in the
.B More
menu let you load the Riff tool from the Snarf buffer and from
a Standard MIDI File, respectively.
.SP
After loading a phrase into the Riff tool, you can play it by clicking the
mouse button anywhere within the phrase window.  Clicking the mouse again,
while the phrase is playing, will terminate playback.  The
.B Loop
button is a toggle switch - if you turn it on, the phrase will be
played repeatedly until you explicitly terminate it, either by turning the
.B Loop
mode off or by clicking the mouse within the phrase window.
.SP
The
.B "Loop Quant->"
item lets you select the value by which the loop repeat time will be quantized.
For example, if the Riff tool contains a phrase whose length is not
exactly a multiple of 4 beats, you will probably want to set the loop
quantization value to 4b.
Similarly, the
.B "Start Quant->"
item lets you select the quantization value used whenever the riff
is started.
.SP
The
.B Snarf
item in the
.B More
menu will put the current phrase into the Snarf buffer.
The
.B Strip
item will strip the current phrase - all leading and trailing space (rests)
will be removed.
.H1 "RiffRaff" wriffraf tools:02
The
.B Riffraff
tool is an interactive toy that lets you trade licks with yourself.  The
.B On
button is a toggle that turns it on and off.  If you turn it on, you should
hear a rhythm (assuming you have a General Midi synth, or at the very least
assuming you have drum sounds on channel 10).  If you play something on
your MIDI keyboard, you will hear it echoed with about an 8 beat delay.
However, it is not echoed verbatim - what you hear is a variation of
what you played.  The default rhythm has bass notes as well, so you will
need to improvise in the key of G.
.SP
The
.B More
menu lets you alter the rhythms - there are two rhythms that are alternated,
and you can set them independently.  The rhythms have no bass notes, so
you can improvise more freely if you change the rhythms.
.H1 "Tempo" wtempo tools:02
The
.B Tempo
tool is a slider that you can use to control the tempo of all
realtime phrase playback.
The tempo can be adjusted at any time, and the effect is immediate.
.H1 "Volume" wvol tools:02
The
.B Volume
tool is a slider that you can use to control the volume of MIDI output.
Moving the slider will generate volume controller messages on all 16 channels.
.SP
The
button immedately below the slider controls whether the generated messages
are added to the Recorded phrase.
The default value of this button is
.B NoRec,
so that the controller messages are not recorded.
Changing the value to
.B Rec
(by pressing the button and selecting "Rec")
will cause all of the controller message to be recorded.
This would mean, for example, that you could play back something
in the Group tool, adjust the volume in realtime by moving the slider
of the
.B Volume
tool, and then use the
.B File->Add Track->Last Overdub
feature of the Group tool to add the volume controller messages
as a new track.
.H1 "WWWtools" wwwtools tools:02
The
.B WWWtools
tool was written by
Mehmet Okonsar (mokonsar@dominet.in.com.tr)
as a wrapper around some of the algorithms used in
the "Tune Toys" web-based applications written by Tim Thompson.
In some sense it is a way of exploring those algorithms in much greater
detail, and to use them in new ways.
You use the buttons as follows:
.SP
.B Word
.SP
Use this button to enter a string for generating algorithms. One may also
read a text file (*.txt). Long strings may produce (very) long sequences !
.SP
.B BSW
.SP
Here you may enter various options for key notes, key phrases and guide
phrases.
.SP
.B ROOT
.SP
This button is for root notes patterns.  You may enter patterns
(as time in clicks or beat) or you may cancel the entry to have the
default values : 4b-2b-1b-2b.  Select "None" to not have any root added.
.SP
.B GEN
.SP
Here you "compose" by selecting the algorithms:
"Algorithm I" requires a string (referred to as "WORD") and uses BSWWW
with the options previously selected.
"Algorithm II" requires a string and reads the first slider
at left (which controls LENGTH), and uses ECHOVARIETY and POLISHIT algorithms.
"Algorithm III" requires a string and reads the first
slider at left (controlling LENGTH), and uses ECHOVARIETY only.
"Rework phrase" gives the option of transforming by ECHOVARIETY
and/or POLISHIT any phrase from the Snarf, or from a file.
.SP
.B Snarf
.SP
Snarf the resulting phrase (shown in the bottom window)
.SP
.B Write
.SP
Writes the resulting phrase (shown in the bottom window) as standard
midi file
.SP
The sliders are, from left to right:
.br
1.   Length of the total sequence 
.br
2.   Number of echoes for the first generator
.br
3.   Delay of the echoes for the first generator
.br
4.   Number of echoes for the second generator
.br
 ...etc...
