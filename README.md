KeyKit - Musical Fun with Windows, Tasks, and Objects

by Tim Thompson (me@timthompson.com)

For use on Windows, just unzip the dist/key_nt.zip and execute the bin/key.exe you find inside.

Other platforms that should work: dist/key_raspbian.zip (Raspberry Pi/ARM) and dist/key_linux.zip (Linux/Intel).

You'll find formatted documentation in:
<ul>
<li>
doc/tutorial.html (Tutorial)
<li>
doc/language.html (Language Reference)
<li>
lib/index.html (GUI Tools in the lib directory)
<li>
doc/faq.html (FAQ)
<li>
doc/keyvar.html (Special Variables)
<li>
doc/libdoc.html (Library functions)
<li>
doc/hacking.html (Hacking guidance)
</ul>

See the README.* files for platform-specific info on compiling.
See the doc directory for other documentation.  In particular,
see doc/porting for details on the machine-dependent support
needed for a given platform.

Other than for the distributions mentioned above, much of the machine-dependent support
in the mdep directory is probably obsolete and will no longer work without modification,
but is being retained for future use.

BTW, when you see "nt" in names - e.g. the mdep/nt directory, or the install_nt target
in the makefile - it refers to the Windows version.  The fact that it refers to Windows NT
indicates just how ancient KeyKit is.  :-)
