<tool name="Mouse Matrix" class="wmatrix">
The
<b>"Mouse Matrix"</b>
tool is an interactive toy.  Each cell of the grid it displays contains
a different chord.  Pressing the left mouse button within a cell
plays its chord.  Dragging the mouse (while its button is pressed)
across the grid generates interesting sounds.

The left mouse button plays notes on channel 1, by default.
The right mouse button plays notes on channel 10, by default, which is
the drum channel of General MIDI synthesizers.  You can change these
two defaults by setting the values of the
<b>Mmchan1</b>
and
<b>Mmchan2</b>
variables - either interactively, by typing in the Console window,
or by putting statements into your
<b>prerc</b>
function.

For each cell, four notes are played as a chord.  You can change the number
of notes in the chord by setting the
<b>Mmsize</b>
variable (again, interactively or in
<b>prerc</b>
).  Valid values for
<b>Mmsize</b>
are 4, 3, 2 and 1.
For example, typing
<b>Mmsize=1</b>
in the Console window would cause the
<b>"Mouse Matrix"</b>
tool to produce single notes for each cell.
