<tool name="Apply" class="wapply">
The
<b>Apply</b>
tool is a utility for taking multiple phrases and applying their attributes
to some target phrase.
The
<b>PH1 ,</b>
<b>PH2 ,</b>
<b>PH3 ,</b>
and
<b>PH4</b>
buttons let you read four phrases (either from Standard MID Files, or
from the Snarf).  The
<b>Apply</b>
button lets you load the target phrase (from Standard MIDI Files, or from
one of the other four phrases).  The
<b>Apply </b>
button then is used to apply the attributes
(such as pitch, duration, or timing) from the other phrases to this target
phrase.
