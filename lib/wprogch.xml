<tool name="Prog Change" class="wprogch">
The
<b>Prog Change</b>
tool lets you generate program change messages.  There is a separate menu
button for each of the 16 MIDI channels.
When you press these buttons, you will see the General MIDI patch list.
When you select a patch from the list, the appropriate program change
message will be transmitted on MIDI output.
<blankline/>
Although the default list of patches is intended for use with General MIDI
synthesizers, you can change the list of patches by editing the
<font class="fixed">lib/maps.k</font>
file (there are comments in that file that explain what to do).
The functions in
<font class="fixed">maps.k</font>
are used by several KeyKit tools (e.g. the
<b>Group</b>
and
<b>Kboom</b>
tools also use the program and drum maps specified there).
