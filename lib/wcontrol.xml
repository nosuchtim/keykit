<tool name="Controller" class="wcontrol">
The
<b>Controller</b>
tool lets you generate MIDI controller messages, such as volume and pan.
There are sixteen sliders, each corresponding to one of the
sixteen MIDI channels.  Moving a slider will generate messages on that channel.
The menu button in the upper-left corner lets you specify
which type of message is generated.  Some of the message types (for
example, "reverb depth") are specific to General MIDI devices.

The
<b>Send</b>
button, when pressed, will send the current controller values (as specified
by the current settings of the 16 sliders) to MIDI output.  The
<b>Snarf</b>
button will take all of these messages and, rather than sending them to
MIDI output, put them in the Snarf buffer.
