<tool name="Bounce" class="wbounce">
The
<b>Bounce</b>
tools is an odd toy.  It consists of four
<b>Riff</b>
tools surrounding a bouncing line.  Press the 
<b>On</b>
toggle button to turn the bouncing line on and off.  You won't hear anything
initially because there's nothing in any of the Riff
tools.  Put a phrase into one of the Riff tools - see the documentation on
the Riff tool for instructions on how to do that.
Then start the bouncing line.  Each time the line touches the side of that
Riff tool, it will send a
<b>bang</b>
message to the Riff tool, causing it to play its phrase.

You'll normally want to put simple phrases (chords, or drum beats)
into each Riff tool.  The
<b>"Chord Palette"</b>
tool is a good way of generating (and Snarfing) chords that can then
be placed in each Riff tool.  Or you can just play something on your
MIDI input device and use the
<b>"Load Rec"</b>
item in the Riff tool to grab and use it.

You'll very likely want to use the
<b>"Start Quant->"</b>
item in the Riff tool to quantize the start time of each of the
four Riffs that the Bounce tool is playing.

The
<b>Speed</b>
slider can be used to adjust the speed of the bouncing line.
