The
<b>"Markov Maker"</b>
tool lets you create music with markov-chain techniques.
The top phrase window displays some existing piece of music that you read in,
and the bottom phrase window display a "similar" piece of music
that is created by the
<b>"Markov Maker."</b>
<p>
First, use the
<b>"Read->File"</b>
item of the
<b>Orig</b>
menu to read in a piece of music.  (Try one of the Bach pieces in the
<b>music</b>
directory.)
<p>
Then use the nested menus under
<b>"Orig->Set Sim"</b>
to initialize the
Markov model of the music.  You can experiment with the values, but
for good initial results, try
<b>"Win 1b/2"</b>
and
<b>"Inc 1b/4."</b>
The
<b>Win</b>
value is the "window" that is
swept across the phrase, and the
<b>Inc</b>
value is the increment by which
the window is moved across the phrase.  (See the source code
in
<font  class="fixed" >lib/setsim.k</font>
for more details.)
<p>
Now, use the
<b>"Sim->Make Sim->"</b>
menu to select the size of the "similar" phrase that you want to generate.
Pressing the mouse button inside either phrase window will start
(and stop) its playing.
You can use
<b>Sim->Snarf</b>
to grab the generated phrase and then
(for example) read it it into a
<b>Group</b>
tool for further editing.
<p>
The
<b>"Markov Maker"</b>
tool is perhaps the easiest thing to impress
people with.  As an example, use
<font  class="fixed" >music/prelude.mid</font>
as the music,
and
<b>"Win 1b/2"</b>
and
<b>"Inc 1b/4"</b>
as the values, and generate a fairly
long piece.  It's surprising how interesting the results are.
