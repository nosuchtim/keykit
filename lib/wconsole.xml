<tool name="Console" class="wconsole">
The
<b>Console</b>
tool creates a new interactive interpreter in which you can type KeyKit
statements and have them executed.  You can have multiple Console
tools on the screen simultaneously, though only one of them is the
current Console, on which the output of
<b>print</b>
statements will appear, and to which keypresses are directed.
If you create a new Console tool, it immediately becomes the current Console.
Pressing the left mouse button within a Console tool causes it to become
the current Console - this is the way you can switch between several
Console windows.

The scroll bar on the left side of the Console tool can be used to
scroll backwards and forwards through its displayed text.
The special variable
<b>Textscrollsize</b>
controls how many lines are available in the Console tool.  The default
value is 200, although you can change this in your
<b>prerc</b>
function.
