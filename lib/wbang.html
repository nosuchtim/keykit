The
<b>Bang</b>
tool is a utility for sending messages to other tools.
The
<b>Add</b>
and
<b>Del</b>
buttons are used to add and delete connections between the Bang tool
and other tools.  To make a connection, press and hold the mouse on the
<b>Add</b>
button, and drag the mouse away.  You will see a line stretching as you
drag the mouse.  Drag the line so that it ends up on the desired tool,
and release the mouse.  The connection is now made.  To check the connection,
press the
<b>Add</b>
button - all of the current connections will be displayed until you release
the button.  The
<b>Del</b>
button is used just like the
<b>Add</b>
button, except that it removes connections - you drag the line to the
tool whose connection you want to delete.
<p>
Pressing the
<b>Bang</b>
button will cause the Bang tool to send a message to all of the connected
tools.  The default message is "bang".  In essence, this will invoke the
<b>bang</b>
method in each of the connected tools.
If a tool does not have a
<b>bang</b>
method, a warning message will be printed in the console window.
<p>
The
<b>More</b>
menu lets you set things up so that the Bang tool will monitor MIDI
input and trigger itself automatically when a particular MIDI message is seen.
To set up this capability, you should first play on your MIDI input
device the desired MIDI message (e.g. a particular note on your keyboard).
Then, invoke the
<b>"Load Recorded"</b>
menu item in the
<b>More</b>
menu.  This will load the MIDI message that you just played.  To have the
Bang tool then continuously monitor MIDI input for this message,
press the
<b>On</b>
button.  This button is a toggle - pressing it again will turn it off.
When the Bang tool is
<b>On,</b>
all MIDI input is monitored, and each occurrence of the
specified MIDI message will cause the Bang tool to trigger and send a
message to all of its connections.
<p>
You can change the message that the Bang tool sends by invoking
the
<b>"Set Message"</b>
item in the
<b>More</b>
menu.  After invoking it, you will see a window in which you can enter
the message name.  The
<b>"Set Comment"</b>
item lets you change the text that is displayed in the center of the Bang
tool.  The
<b>"Delete ALL Trigees"</b>
item will remove all of the Bang tool's connections.
